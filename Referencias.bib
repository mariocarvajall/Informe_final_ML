abstract = {Introduction. Tropical montane forests support a high abundance and diversity of bryophytes and lichens on different substrates. However, quantitative information about how their biomass and water-holding capacity change with elevation is scarce. The current project assessed variation in the biomass and water-holding capacity of bryophytes and lichens on Baru Volcano, Panama. Methods. On the western slope, the bryophyte and lichen layer was collected from 600 cm2 plots on six substrate types with four replications at eight elevations along a gradient from 1900 to 3300 m a.s.l. We recorded the thickness, water-holding capacity and biomass of all samples, as well as environmental parameters. Key results. At lower elevations substrates had a similar biomass and water-holding capacity per area, but with increasing elevation terricolous substrates showed the strongest increase (highest values at 3100 m). These patterns are associated with climatic variation along the gradient. At the highest elevations, the forest was of low stature and more light reached the forest floor. Also at these high elevations fog provides a daily wetting of the bryophytes and lichens. At lower elevations the water supply is increasingly in the form of rain, which is less frequent than the fog. Conclusions. The apparent strong coupling of biomass variations to precipitation regimes implies a high sensitivity of the bryophytes and lichens to climatic warming and changes in the cloud base elevation. Furthermore our data suggest that the importance of bryophytes and lichens for regulating ecosystem water fluxes increases with elevation, which underlines the necessity to conserve intact montane forests.},

abstract = {Epiphytic lichens are an important component of forest biodiversity. Many of them are threatened and conservation planning therefore requires comprehensive information about their distribution over space and time. However, besides topo-climatic predictors, the spatial pattern of epiphytic lichens is also closely related to the tree characteristics on which they grow. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that habitat specialist lichens restricted to specific habitat types and common species with a wide range of ecological preferences may respond differently to the topo-climatic and forest-structure predictors. We applied the generalized linear model (GLM) and maximum entropy (Maxent) for 20 epiphytic lichen species in Switzerland at different spatial scales (1 km and 100 m). To evaluate the influence of forest structure on the epiphytic lichen distribution, models with three sets of predictors (topo-climatic, forest-structure and combined predictor sets) were fitted for each species. Canopy height of forest stands and forest type were tested as a proxy of forest structure. Our results showed that both the techniques applied predicted well the occurrences of habitat specialists but the models of common lichens were overall less accurate. Forest-structure predictors significantly improved the models of rare and threatened species with specific microhabitat requirements, i.e. mainly forest lichens (Arthonia byssacea, Bactrospora dryina, Calicium viride, Gyalecta truncigena and Vulpicida pinastri), but they did not contribute considerably to the models of common species that grow equally well on the bark of different trees within or outside of forests (e.g. Caloplaca cerina, Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Physcia stellaris and Xanthoria parietina). We recommend using high-resolution forest-structure data for robust and reliable predictions of the distribution patterns of threatened epiphytic lichens, most of which are habitat specialists. The inclusion of these data will allow a hypothesis-driven sampling strategy, and will thus increase the effectiveness of the field sampling needed for searching large regions thoroughly to discover new sites where rare and threatened species occur.},

abstract = {The north-western Caucasus is exceptional in Europe because of its 1.3 million hectares of unmanaged ‘virgin' forest. The Caucasus State Nature Reserve protects some 200,000 hectares, but contiguous areas are exposed to forest loss, fragmentation and degradation. Such an extensive region of virgin forest provides a unique opportunity to document diversity along key ecological gradients for an undisturbed system in Europe. Focusing on lichen epiphytes, we surveyed local diversity hot-spots along a 1200 m altitudinal gradient. Our main results are that: (a) species richness is enormously high in 1-hectare plots (between 233 and 358) representing a new baseline for Europe, (b) species composition differs substantially among plots with turnover increasing for difference in altitude. Cumulative species richness along the gradient was 597. More than a half of detected species had an affinity for, or were restricted to either the lower or the uppermost parts of the altitudinal gradient. However, this was related to differences in forest structure, rather than altitude per se. Species richness in plots increased significantly with the proportion of sparse/open forest. Length of an ecotone line, number of available tree and shrub species and number of dominant tree species also tend to increase species richness. These four variables had higher values at the lower and upper parts of the gradient, than at mid-altitudes, explaining a bimodal relationship of species richness with altitude. We conclude that loss of forest habitat at the lower and upper margins of the altitudinal gradient will cause the most significant decline in epiphytic lichen diversity.},

abstract = {In the Alps, many forests are under abandonment because of direct protection or the unprofitability of timber production. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of silviculture abandonment on the species richness and composition of epiphytic and dead wood-dwelling lichens in silver fir woodlands. An abandoned and a currently non-intensively managed forest watershed of the eastern Italian Alps that were matched for topography, stand structure, plant community and history of use were selected and randomly sampled for the lichen diversity of their silver fir mature stands. Generalised linear mixed models were used for the analyses of the species richness, whereas the species composition patterns were explored by redundancy analysis. The diversity of both of the lichen guilds were explained by the microhabitat conditions related to the contrasting management regimes, but they had opposite responses to the abandonment of the silvicultural activities. The epiphytic lichen communities were richer in species in the managed than in the abandoned silver fir woodlands. However, the effect of a 50. year management cessation on the epiphytic lichens may change in the long term when natural disturbances create gaps and increase the attributes of old-growth forests. The dead wood-dwelling lichen species richness was higher in the abandoned forest because an increased availability of types of dead wood is usually rare in managed forests. The dead wood-dwelling lichen communities of the managed forests were a subset of a more diverse community that was developing in the abandoned forest. Our results indicated that, in non-intensively managed silver fir mature stands, lichen diversity may benefit from the retention of logs and snags, which provide habitat features typical of old-growth forests. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The data reported on this study supported the hypothesis that the absence of the lichen Ramalina fastigiata near a copper mine site located on the south of Portugal was related to toxic levels of Cu-dust near the centre of the mine. Lichen biodiversity reflected the impact of the copper-mine dust emissions which were more widespread towards the east, correlated with wind direction and frequency. The chemical analysis of R. fastigiata collected at different distances and in different directions from the mine showed that Cu, K and Mg were derived from the centre of the mine site, confirming thus as the major source of atmospheric dust. Total inhibition of PSII photochemical reactions occurred in R. fastigiata both under field and controlled conditions, when intracellular Cu concentrations exceeded a threshold of approximately 2.0 $\mu$mol g-1. No samples of this species were found under field conditions beyond the Cu threshold. Thus, the fluorescence parameter F(v)/F(m) proved to be a good estimator of the survival capacity of R. fastigiata under field conditions and thus a useful parameter in determining the sensitivity of the lichens (photobiont) to Cu pollution. The intracellular location of Cu allowed an explanation of the physiological changes and the survival of the species in the surroundings of the copper-mine.

abstract = {Aims: To better understand whether and how nitrogen addition impacts the epiphytic lichens in the Shennongjia Nature Reserve (China). Methods: Five dominant epiphytic lichen species, including Usnea longissima, U. luridorufa, Ramalina calicaris var. japonica, U. dasopoga and U. betulina, were selected as materials, and then field and laboratory nitrogen addition experiments were performed. The phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of these lichens were measured, and then the effects of nitrogen addition on thallus nutrient balance and PME activity were discussed. Important Findings: Our results showed that with an increased N deposition from 0.6 to 50 kg N ha-1 a-1, the thallus N content of the five lichen species increased significantly, suggesting that those lichens had strong ability to take up and accumulate N, and an universality of N intolerance in epiphytic lichens. Meanwhile, the P content of five lichens increased slower than N content among N treatments, indicating the supply of P was deteriorated when the supply of N increased. The N addition also led to the N:P ratios of five lichens increased from about 10 to 20, and reached a maximum at 50 kg N ha-1 a-1, and the PME activity of the five lichen species was upregulated by the N addition, indicated that the balance between N and P was deteriorated in these lichens. We concluded that increases in N deposition will lead to nutrient imbalance in lichens and that nitrogen enrichment will change these five lichen species from being N limited to being P limited. Our research will be of value in the conservation of lichen diversity in the Shennongjia Nature Reserve (China).},

Both frequency and Fv/Fm of E. prunastri decreased abruptly above 3 $\mu$g m-3 NH3 suggesting direct adverse effects of NH 3 on its photosynthetic performance. By contrast, X. parietina increased its frequency with NH3, despite showing decreased capacity of photosystem II above 50 $\mu$g m-3 NH3, suggesting that the ecological success of X. parietina at ammonia-rich sites might be related to indirect effects of increased nitrogen (NH3) availability.

Our hypothesis is that increasing human population density and modifying land use and cover cause structural and functional changes in lichen communities. The main objective of this study was to evaluate changes in lichen species composition and functional patterns along a gradient of urbanization in southern Brazil. The study was carried out in nine sites, classified a priori according to the matrix where they were inserted, as rural, suburban and urban, in which the lichen community was sampled in 10 phorophytes using the rubber band method. Several environmental variables and lichen functional traits were quantified. The sites inserted in the rural matrix were characterized by phorophytes with higher bark pH, higher percentage of agriculture areas in the vicinity of the sampling sites, and by the following functional groups: loosely attached crustose thalli, Trentepohlia photobiont, reproduction by thallus fragmentation and apothecia. The sites located in the urban matrix showed greater demographic density, vehicular fleet, percentage of urban and open fields coverage, foliose narrow lobed thalli, photobiont Chlorococcoid algae and reproduction by soredia. Regarding lichen functional patterns, sites located in the rural matrix presented higher species richness, functional richness, evenness and diversity. Based on our results, we showed that urbanization has a strong influence on lichen communities, since it has affected both species composition and functional patterns, besides species richness. The combined use of species composition, richness, functional composition and functional indexes proved to be effective in obtaining detailed information on the changes suffered by lichen communities and can be used as a tool to evaluate the environmental quality in urban environments.},

This study correlated lichen growth forms and total epiphytic abundance across 119 forests located in Europe and Central-South America. A total of 54 papers were selected from specific databases focused on lichens. Additionally, data from several unpublished ecological studies were included. Linear regression models showed that epiphytic lichen abundance was highly and positively correlated with the number of growth forms at all geographical levels considered (i.e., Central-South American and European forests, and the combination of both). Thus, the use of growth forms may provide an alternative and complementary way to evaluate epiphytic diversity because most growth forms have cosmopolitan distribution and are easily recognizable.},

abstract = {Coarse woody residues (snags and logs) are a massive and functionally important component of high-latitude forest ecosystems, both natural and managed. Decaying logs and snags provide habitat for many organisms and participate in biogeochemical element fluxes within the forest ecosystem. Because of their large mass and slow decay rates, they may also play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. For these reasons, it is important to understand the dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD) during forest succession. Here, we estimated the biomass of CWD (defined as logs or snags {\textgreater}10 cm stem diameter) in nine forest stands, both primary and secondary, on Chilo{\'{e}} Island (42°S), southern Chile. The stands represented a successional chronosequence following non-catastrophic human disturbance by fire and logging. We characterized logs in terms of their decay class, total carbon content, moisture content, volume, and dry biomass. CWD biomass ranged from 18 to 413 Mg ha-1, with a recently disturbed and old-growth forests having the largest values. Early- and mid-successional stands had the lowest values. Decay classes of logs differed in density, moisture contents and total carbon content. Carbon stored in logs and snags was nearly 10 times higher in old-growth and primary forests than in young-successional forests. CWD biomass is substantially reduced in young growing stands with disrupting effects on ecological functions and biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Aim: Few studies have explicitly examined the influence of spatial attributes of forest fragments when examining the impacts of fragmentation on woody species. The aim of this study was to assess the diverse impacts of fragmentation on forest habitats by integrating landscape-level and species-level approaches. Location: The investigation was undertaken in temperate rain forests located in southern Chile. This ecosystem is characterized by high endemism and by intensive recent changes in land use. Method: Measures of diversity, richness, species composition, forest structure and anthropogenic disturbances were related to spatial attributes of the landscape (size, shape, connectivity, isolation and interior forest area) of forest fragments using generalized linear models. A total of 63 sampling plots distributed in 51 forest fragments with different spatial attributes were sampled. Results: Patch size wasthe most important attribute influencing different measures of species composition, stand structure and anthropogenic disturbances. The abundance of tree and shrub species associated with interior and edge habitats was significantly related to variation in patch size. Basal area, a measure of forest structure, significantly declined with decreasing patch size, suggesting that fragmentation is affecting successional processes in the remaining forests. Small patches also displayed a greater number of stumps, animal trails and cow pats, and lower values of canopy cover as a result of selective logging and livestock grazing in relatively accessible fragments. However, tree richness and $\beta$-diversity of tree species were not significantly related to fragmentation. Main conclusions: This study demonstrates that progressive fragmentation by logging and clearance is associated with dramatic changes in the structure and composition of the temperate forests in southern Chile. If this fragmentation process continues, the ability of the remnant forests to maintain their original biodiversity and ecological processes will be significantly reduced. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The evaluation of air pollution, namely particulate pollution, in urban areas is performed by air quality monitoring stations. These, are not sufficiently distributed in space to cover all areas with high spatial resolution, needed for a good assessment of the exact human exposure. In this context, lichen diversity studies could fill the gap of increasing air quality spatial resolution in areas not covered by monitoring stations. We aim at using taxonomic (species richness and abundance) and trait-based epiphytic lichen diversity (growth form) to evaluate the impact of air pollution levels in Chilean urban environments. For that, lichen diversity was evaluated in three background areas, seven centres of various Chilean cities and their peri-urban zones. Though trait-based metrics responded negatively to air pollution, lichen abundance was the best metrics (index of lichen diversity), being negatively associated (r = −0.89; p {\textless} 0.001) with the number of days per year that particles exceeded the mean annual level established by legislation ({\textgreater}20 µg m−3 year−1). This suggested that the main source of changes in lichen diversity in urban areas of Chile is particulate material or other associated pollutants. These findings show that in high levels of pollution, total lichen diversity can be used to track particulate material pollution above the recommended levels, providing data for areas without monitoring stations. This information can then be used to select new areas for monitoring stations, or to evaluate the potential health effects of the population living in these areas.},

One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

In three study areas, between 55{\%} and 70{\%} of the species became rarer during the 100-150-year long observation period. In the spatially extended study areas Weser-Ems Lowlands and Solling Mountains, 36{\%} or 39{\%} of the species, respectively, could not be rediscovered in the recent survey. Considering that species might have been overlooked during revisitation, the extinction rate was estimated to be 28{\%} in the Weser-Ems Lowlands and 30{\%} in the Solling Mountains based on a estimated probability for recovering the species of 75{\%} in crustose lichens and 90{\%} in foliose and fruticose lichens. The main causes of the species decline are thought to be forest management (especially the reduction of overmature and decaying trees), the reduction of soil moisture and, with it, air humidity due to drainage as well as the deposition of acidifying and fertilizing substances from the atmosphere. Lichens specialized on rain-sheltered bark furrows and cavities of old trees or smooth, shady bark or moist thick-stemmed deadwood in the forest interior have suffered the strongest declines, including the epiphyte flora of Fagus sylvatica, Central Europe's most abundant native forest tree species.

However, the composition of lichen communities shows a different pattern, based on the relative values of functional groups. Some functional groups, such as oligotrophic, hygrophytic and acidophilous lichens, are sensitive to pollution caused by traffic, and their richness declines markedly close to roads. These groups are well represented in areas without traffic, especially in park and residential areas. Otherwise, eutrophic, xerophytic and basophilous lichens are more represented in traffic areas.
